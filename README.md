# Exploring Supervised Classification Techniques and Feature Selection in Scikit-learn

This project, a group assignment for COMP 8740 at the University of Windsor, has been undertaken by the following members:

- **Ankur Mangroliya**
- **Gagandeep Singh**
- **Deon Victor Lobo**
- **Akshar Patel**

## Introduction

The project's primary aim is to delve into supervised classification techniques using Scikit-learn. The team explored various datasets—circles, moons, spirals—employing Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network classifiers, evaluating their performance through 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, they delved into the breast cancer dataset, applying feature selection methods such as Chi-squared and mRMR to enhance the classifiers' performance using metrics like PPV, NPV, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. This project is dedicated to comprehending classifier performance, feature selection methods, and their practical applications.

## Implementation

This Python-based project defines three classifiers, configures their settings, and iterates through diverse datasets. It separates features and labels, conducts cross-validation, and extracts pivotal performance metrics for analysis and model comparison. The team aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different classifiers through visualizations and performance result tables.

## Group Efforts

The comprehensive report entails an extensive analysis of various classifier performances across diverse datasets, highlighting the distinctive capabilities of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The performance concerning binary classification using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers has been deeply explored.

## Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

The report thoroughly scrutinizes strategies to handle class imbalance and the rationale behind selecting the One-vs-One (OvO) technique. Additionally, the team implements Chi2 and mRMR feature selection methods in combination with RandomForest and OneVsOne schemes, presenting detailed outputs in the appendix.

## Conclusion

This project thoroughly reviews classifier performance, feature selection methodologies, and the application of machine learning techniques across various datasets. It aims to enrich the understanding of classification and feature selection in real-world applications.
