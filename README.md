# Exploring-Supervised-Classification-Techniques-and-Feature-Selection-in-Scikit-learn
This project is a group assignment undertaken by students of the University of Windsor (COMP 8740). The group members include:

- **Ankur Mangroliya **
- **Gagandeep Singh **
- **Deon Victor Lobo **
- **Akshar Patel **

## Introduction

The primary focus of this project is to explore supervised classification techniques using Scikit-learn. The group downloaded various datasets (circles, moons, spirals) and applied Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network classifiers. They assessed their performance using 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, they delved into the breast cancer dataset, applying feature selection methods like Chi-squared and mRMR to improve the classifiers' performance using metrics like PPV, NPV, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. This project is dedicated to understanding classifier performance, feature selection methods, and their real-world applications.

## Implementation

The project comprises Python code that defines three classifiers, specifies their configurations, and iterates through different datasets. It separates features and labels, performs cross-validation, and extracts crucial performance metrics for analysis and comparison among the models. The group aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different classifiers through visualizations and tables displaying performance results.

## Group Efforts

The comprehensive report involves a detailed analysis of various classifier performances on different datasets, outlining the distinctive capabilities of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The performance on binary classification using Decision Tree, RandomForest, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers is deeply explored.

## Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

The report analyzes the strategies employed for handling class imbalance and the reasons for selecting the One-vs-One (OvO) technique. Furthermore, the group implements Chi2 and mrmr feature selection methods in combination with RandomForest and OneVsOne schemes, presenting their outputs through detailed appendix sections.

## Conclusion

This project extensively reviews classifier performance, feature selection methodologies, and the application of machine learning techniques on various datasets, aiming to enrich the understanding of classification and feature selection in real-world scenarios.
